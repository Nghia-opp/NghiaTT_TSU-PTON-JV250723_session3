    <h1>Đôi lời tự sự của bản thân</h1>
    <h2>A few words of self-reflection</h2>
        <p>
        I chose this path believing it would lead me closer to something I truly longed for. <br/>
        But somewhere along the way, I began to wonder if the destination I had in mind still felt right. <br/>
        There’s a quiet ache in realizing that decisions—especially the ones made with care—can still leave you feeling uncertain. <br/>
        Yet even with that doubt, I’ve come to accept that this moment is mine to live, to learn, and to grow from. <br/>
        Maybe the beauty isn’t in always knowing... but in continuing anyway.
